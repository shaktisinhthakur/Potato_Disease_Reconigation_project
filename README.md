# Potato_Disease_Reconigation_project
This repository contains a deep learning–based potato leaf disease recognition model developed using Keras with the TensorFlow backend. The model is trained on labeled images of potato leaves and is capable of identifying common diseases by learning important visual patterns such as discoloration, texture changes, and lesion formations on leaves.

The primary objective of this project is to support early and accurate detection of potato plant diseases, which can help farmers and researchers take timely preventive actions and reduce crop losses. This project demonstrates the practical use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification in the agricultural domain.

# Potato_Disease_Reconigation_project
🥔 Potato Leaf Disease Recognition using Keras (Deep Learning)
This repository contains a trained Keras deep learning model for recognizing diseases in potato leaves using image data.
The goal of this project is to help in early detection of potato plant diseases, which can reduce crop loss and improve agricultural productivity.

🔍 About the Model
Built using Keras with TensorFlow backend
Trained on labeled potato leaf images
Capable of classifying:
Healthy potato leaves
Early Blight
Late Blight (if applicable – keep only what your model supports)
The model learns visual patterns such as leaf color, texture, and spots to accurately identify the disease.
